<h1>Among Us. </h1>

<p> In Among Us you must complete tasks and go home, but there is an imposter Among us,
(Get it) Anyway- the imposters job is to kill everyone on the ship and get away with it.
Meaning that the imopster has to lie to and decive the crewmates to get away with (murder) it so make sure to watch your
back.

</p>
<p> Crewmates,
Your job is pretty easy just do task and watch out for the imposter you never know where they may be. If you find a dead body report it instantly other wise
you might be voted off for being sus (suspicious) and not reporting it but bewere the imposter can self report. you can also call emergancy meetings.
The imposter can sabatage (light, comms, reacter, and o2) you must fix these thing before the imposter gets you, Good luck. 
</p>
<p> Imposters,
Your job is simple but hard so be prepared. You must kill everyone before you get caught, you have the ability
to sabatage the light,o2,comms, and reactor (by the way if you sabatage the lights you can still see but the
crewmates can't). You also have the ability to close doors and travel through the vents just don't get caught.
If by chance you get caught you can try and blame it on the other person, through out the game you can try and get some of the crewmates trust, doing so gives you an
another chance but if you lose that trust its pretty much game over, Good luck
</p>
<h2> there is one Imposter Among You Good luck you'll need it.
